These four data files are from published datasets. I refer those interested to those papers.

Details on the helminth life cycle database (CLC_database_hosts.csv and CLC_database_lifehistory.csv) can be found [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.1680/suppinfo).

The size-structure of published food webs was summarized by [Brose et al.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2411:CBRINF]2.0.CO;2/full).

Finally, the host mass data is compiled from several sources, including Pantheria.
